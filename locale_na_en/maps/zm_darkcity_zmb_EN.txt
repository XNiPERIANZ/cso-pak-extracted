This town was full of laughter of children, and everyone thought the love and happiness would last for eternity. However, now the town is just dark and silent. The town is dead. 

We are just living without any purpose. We are just looking each other's face for nothing.

What we do is just remembering our beloved families, friends... Our purpose is to survive everyday... Relying on each other... We prepare to say goodbye to our friends everyday when the dark comes... And it just became a part of our lives...

- Human: Prepare for the Zombie attacks and secure the safety zone and survive until the dawn.
