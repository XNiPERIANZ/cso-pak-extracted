Research into the zombie virus continues slowly, yet steadily...
Meanwhile, experiments on zombie mutations and combat testing take place in an abandoned factory.

Test subjects are selected among the survivors most susceptible to virus mutation.
Their virus mutations are used to their advantage, and they test strategies to be used in actual combat.

The risk is great, but the very survival of humanity is at stake.
Only the most courageous volunteer for combat testing.

Humans: Survive the zombie attacks until time runs out, or kill all the zombies.
Zombies: Kill all the humans and turn them into zombies. Zombies have more HP and are faster than humans.
