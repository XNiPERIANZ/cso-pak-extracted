Unidentified creatures, possibly zombies, have been detected at the entrance to an abandoned amusement park.
The only chance the survivors have is to take refuge inside the amusement park, position themselves for a final stand, and work together.

Humans: Survive the zombie attacks until time runs out, or kill all the zombies.
Zombies: Kill all the humans and turn them into zombies. Zombies have more HP and are faster than humans.
