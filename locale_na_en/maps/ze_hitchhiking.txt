After the fall of the Vanguard company... 

David Black and Erica’s remnant forces went missing while on a mission. Meanwhile, an unknown group recovers important research data from the Vanguard company which stands in ruin.

The mysterious male leader of the group and his troops take the recovered items and head toward the polar region. This mission, with an unclear destination, appears to be going smoothly but is always faced with a sudden threat. 
On the way to the polar region, a mysterious infection takes over the group and the unidentified group, surrounded by the wails of mysterious creatures must now make an escape without even knowing who is chasing them.

- Humans: Make your way to the transport train located at the escape location before time is up. You must remain a Human at all cost!
- Zombies: Infect all the Humans or go to the escape location and prevent the Humans from getting away before time is up.
