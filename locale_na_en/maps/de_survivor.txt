During a severe snowstorm, an airplane that was carrying classified cargo crashed into the ground. The onboard crew safely escaped using parachutes and transferred the cargo from the plane to a truck. However, they were unable to transfer all of the cargo due to the large amount of snow.

The Terrorists who were tracking the airplane are planning to make sure that the cargo that is on the truck and airplane do not make it out safely.

- Terrorists: Bomb the truck or crashed plane.
- Counter-Terrorists: Prevent the Terrorists from bombing the targets.
