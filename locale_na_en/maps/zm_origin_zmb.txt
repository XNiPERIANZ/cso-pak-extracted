Origin - Zombie

Planning/Production: NEXON
Texture/Revision: NEXON

The situation at the cemetery, that had appeared unsurvivable, quickly turned as a large Zombie force, composed of various ethnicities, joined the ranks. The Zombies, who had managed to corner the survivors and were preparing for a last attack, suffered an unexpected raid by the survivors and the few remaining quickly disappeared underground.

“We cannot miss out on this opportunity to annihilate the Cemetery Zombies!”

The survivors, after bracing themselves, chased the Zombies down into the basements. It didn't take them long however to realize that this was a foolish mistake...

- Humans: How is it possible that there was such a vast space underground?
- Zombies: Exit... blocked... humans... annihilate them...
