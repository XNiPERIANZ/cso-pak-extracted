During the battle between Terrorists and Counter-Terrorists, unidentified beings have been discovered which appear to be zombies that escaped from the Rex Laboratory. The humans must now work together in order to survive.

Humans: Survive the zombie attacks for the remaining duration or kill all the zombies.
Zombies: Those who have turned into Zombies must kill the humans and turn them into Zombies. Zombies have higher HP and faster speeds than Humans.
