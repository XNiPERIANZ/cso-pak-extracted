Dazzling – Bomb Planting/Defusing

Planning/Production: NEXON
Texture/Modeling/Revision: NEXON

Indications of possible plans for Terrorist bombings have been discovered in the downtown area of Hong Kong. The government has dispatched a Counter-Terrorist force into the location to prevent any Terrorist acts.

- Terrorists: Use any means necessary to plant a C4 in a location where vehicles are crowded together. You must divert the attention of the government and the Counter-Terrorists through a large explosion.
- Counter-Terrorists: Prevent a Terrorist act from occurring where civilian facilities are concentrated. The lives of the innocent population must not be sacrificed.
