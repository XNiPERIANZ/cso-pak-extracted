Requiem - Annihilation: Beast 

Planning/Production: NEXON
Texture/Revision: NEXON

Travelers from the past remember this place as a small peaceful village. That was before the sins of a cruel and wicked history received its judgement here... Darkness has fallen and the rotten stench of the walking dead has taken over. The survivors had no choice but to do all it took to escape this fallen village. Loving family, friends, colleagues... all had been changed into blood-thirsty monsters.

“May the cursed souls hear a requiem ringing throughout this place where living is worse than dying!”
