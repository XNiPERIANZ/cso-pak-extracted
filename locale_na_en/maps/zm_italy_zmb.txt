Italy - Joseon Markets - Zombie
Developed and produced by: Nexon
Texture/Modeling/Edited by: Nexon

Long ago, when dynasties still ruled Korea...
The dead awoke in an unknown plague.

Now, only the chirping of crickets pierce the silence of night...
With the sad song of a gayageum, as consolation for all that was lost.

Those who survived flee from the infected, building their defenses for the inevitable confrontation.

Humans: Survive the zombie attacks until time runs out, or kill all the zombies.
Zombies: Kill all the humans and turn them into zombies. Zombies have more HP and are faster than humans.
