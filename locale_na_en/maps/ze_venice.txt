Italy's northern port city of Venice, with its warm sunlight and the peaceful sound of waves, was beautiful enough to allow anyone to forget the horrors of the Zombies. Survivors from throughout the world who escaped from the attack of the Zombies were able to spend a peaceful and leisurely time in their new home. 

But even that peace was momentary... Due to the poor management of carriers of the virus, their new home soon turned into an island from hell... At the moment when all hope seemed to disappear, radio contact was made with a transport helicopter pilot sent to search for survivors in other areas.

- Humans: Make your way to the escape location and request assistance from the transport helicopter pilot to flee Venice!
- Zombies: Infect all the Humans or take over the approaching transport helicopter and prevent the Humans from getting away!
