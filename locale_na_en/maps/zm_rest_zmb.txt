Rest - Zombie

Planning/Production: NEXON
Texture/Revision: NEXON

Only a few remain from the bloody battle for survival. 

“Is there no more hope...?”

The dim light that can be seen coming from the cemetery a far distance away seems to suggest a sanctuary leading the survivors forward.

"This may be the sanctuary where we can finally die in peace..."

- Humans: It's a desperate situation but you must do everything you can to get away!
- Zombies: Hung...er...Human...smell...Whooooaaa! Whoooaaa!!
