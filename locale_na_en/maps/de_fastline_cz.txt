The Asian International Peace Talks are planned to be held tomorrow in Tokyo. The Terrorists are planning to prevent a successful outcome of these talks by bombing the congested Tokyo subways during the early morning before the talks.

- Terrorists: Prevent a successful outcome of the peace talks by bombing one of the two bombing sites located within the Bullet Train Station.
- Counter-Terrorists: Prevent the station from being bombed so that the peace talks can be held successfully.
