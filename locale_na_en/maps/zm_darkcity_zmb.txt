Dark City - Zombie
Planning and Production: Nexon
Graphics: Nexon

To think, the inhabitants of this city once thought that they would grow old with their loved ones. That was before the city had become swallowed up by darkness.
Those who remain have survived countless battles and storms of gunfire, their dead eyes and hardened hearts speak volumes.

In remembrance of those who were taken too soon, their goal has become clearer than ever: defeat the zombies together.

And from the abyss of darkness... bidding farewell to fellow survivors each night has become a little too routine...

Mission:
Humans: Secure a safe place to attack zombies and survive until the sun rises.
Zombies: Infect all living things!
