Forsaken - Zombie Giant
Planning and Production: Nexon
Graphics: Nexon

The zombies have mutated into more powerful, horrid beings. In fact, with such power even Giant Zombies could make their way through defensive lines to torment the living. People were forced to flee their homes in evacuations to army bases and shelters.

With resources and hope running low, the survivors began organizing attacks against the zombies. Leaving the safe zone risks their lives, but someone must bravely fight against the zombies.

Abandoned Village
This battlefield was once called home. The arrival of Giant Zombies forced people to either flee or to stay and fight.
