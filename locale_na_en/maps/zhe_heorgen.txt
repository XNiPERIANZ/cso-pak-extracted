Heorgen - Escape
Developed and produced by: Nexon
Texture/Modeling/Edited by: Nexon

The town of Heorgen was where the outbreak began.

Bathed in moonlight and shrouded in fog, the unassuming quiet of the town belies the many innocents who perished there.
The night's calm is broken only by the howl of the cold wind and the dim lamplight of the mausoleum.

Objective
- Humans : Activate all of the Generators located throughout the town of Heorgen, open the escape route, and flee to the outskirts of the town.
- Zombie : Find all the survivors and incapacitate them to prevent their escape.
