Shoreline - Zombie
Planning and Production: Nexon
Graphics: Nexon

The dispatched secret forces were too busy constantly escaping the monstrous creatures to investigate the truth of the infections.

After continuously trying to stay one step ahead of the infected, they arrived at a small plot near the shore. There, they waited anxiously to be rescued. Unbeknownst to them, one of their own had already been infected and were slowly succumbing by the virus.

Those in the base were left with nothing, unaware of the terror rising out of the darkness they hoped to escape.

Mission:
Humans: Secure a safe place to attack zombies and survive until the sun rises.
Zombies: Infect all living things!
