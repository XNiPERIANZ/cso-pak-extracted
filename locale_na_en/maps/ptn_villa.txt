Villa (villa) - Partner Mode - Bomb Plant / Defusal
Map created by: Nexon
Texture created by: Nexon

In an abandoned villa on the outskirts of the city, the Counter-Terrorists
and Terrorists begin their virtual infiltration and defense training.

Attacking Team (TR):
The attacking team (TR) spawns on all sides of the villa, north, south, east, and west,
and must locate targets inside the villa to be bombed or eliminate
the entire defending team (CT) to accomplish the mission.
It's possible to use Partners to locate the C4 and opponents inside.

Defending Team (CT):
The defending team (CT) spawns inside the villa, on the 1st and 2nd floors,
to defend the targets from the enemy team (TR) or wipe them out.
The defending team can check the location of the C4 from the moment they spawn.
It's possible to use Partners to set up defensive formations.

Notes:
The map has 10 possible C4 locations, from which 1 location will be randomly selected.
Each team must alter their tactics depending on the location of the C4.
